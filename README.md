# HBO-Max-Enhanced
An updated extension of HBO Enhanced for chrome that works with HBO Max (as well as HBO NOW). Original extension is here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbo-enhanced/kibhmcdemphikjllndhmdjfailnllbjo

Download these files as a zip, extract the HBO-Max-Enhanced-master.zip file (you should be left with a folder of the same name), go to settings>extensions>load unpacked in Chrome or Edge (chromium), and choose the folder.

This extension allows you to use the spacebar as a pause button and the left and right arrow keys as 10 sec forwards/backwards buttons. Unfortunately, the up and down arrow keys don't allow you to change the volume like in the original release.
