# HBO-Max-Enhanced
An updated extension of HBO Enhanced for chrome that works with HBO Max (as well as HBO NOW). Original extension is here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbo-enhanced/kibhmcdemphikjllndhmdjfailnllbjo (NOTE: I did not create this extension, I simply modified two lines from the original so it works with HBO Max, and shared the code. The original code belongs to Nicholas Robinson (nrobinson), and I'd be happy to take it down if requested)

Download these files as a zip, extract the HBO-Max-Enhanced-master.zip file (you should be left with a folder of the same name), go to settings>extensions>load unpacked in Chrome or Edge (chromium), and choose the folder.

This extension allows you to use the spacebar as a pause button and the left and right arrow keys as 10 sec forwards/backwards buttons. Unfortunately, the up and down arrow keys don't allow you to change the volume like in the original release.
